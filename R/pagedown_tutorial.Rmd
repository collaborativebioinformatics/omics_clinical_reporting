[Patient Information]{.red}
================================================================================

This section provides information on the patient and their relevant clinical information. 

::: member-cards  

## Patient Anonymous ID

this is a subtitle. 
Need to provide a table here. 

## Patient DOB

```{r echo=FALSE}
#These need to become API queries to an EHR database or other clinical database which has the patient information and the test information
pt.info <- data.frame("Information"=c("Name:", 
                                        "DOB:",
                                        "Sex:",
                                        "Genetic Tests:"), 
                        "Value"=c("Jane Doe","01/01/1900","F","RNA, DNA, and TCR sequencing"))

[Genetic Tests]{.blue}
================================================================================

```{r, include=FALSE}
genetic_testing = 'Genetic testing was carried out using RNA-sequencing, DNA-sequencing, and TCR sequencing. These data were used to determine the expressed variants for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by transcriptomics, and  also allowed one to determine  both somatic and germline variants using DNA. In addition, large chromosomal rearrangment, called structural variants (SVs), were identifed using [DNA or RNA?] sequencing. Finally,  TCR sequencing allows one to investigate how immune system/inflammation maybe affected due to disease or other underlying conditions.'
```

## Genetic testing performed

`r genetic_testing`

![The genetic testing results are compiled and the report is produced with  **OmicsReportR**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41301333/120476740-dd4f1d80-c3a2-11eb-9c81-248f56bfb84f.png)

## Test Information

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#These need to become API queries to an EHR database or other clinical database which has the patient information and the test information
test.info <- data.frame("Testing Methodolgy"=c("DNA-seq:", 
                                    "RNA-seq:",
                                    "TCR-seq:"),
